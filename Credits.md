Special thanks goes to Gary Keith for the big job he does maintaining the [Browser Capabilities](http://browsers.garykeith.com/) project and offering such great support, as well as to [Alexandre Alapetite](http://alexandre.alapetite.net/) for pointing me in [the right direction](http://alexandre.alapetite.net/doc-alex/php-local-browscap/index.en.html) and to the [guys from ba!joodoo](http://www.bajoodoo.com/) for the first implementation of an interval based update version.
